## Getting Started

Following are system level dependecies, and must be present on your machine before you run cookiecutter command. Primarily for `pre_gen_project.sh` to complete successfully.

- **postgres** - can be installed with `brew install postgres`
- **fabric** - can be installed with `sudo pip install fabric`

You should able to install these fairly easily if your developement machine is other than a Mac OS X.

You need to have `cookiecutter` installed in order to scafold a new project from this template. If you have `pip` installed, you simply do this by running:

```
sudo pip install --upgrade cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/Fueled/cookiecutter-django.git
```

It will ask you to some questions, after which it will create a new project in your current working directory. It will also create a virtualenv in the folder `venv` inside the project, and install all the python dependencies inside it.

Once the cookiecutter script finishes, you'll have:

1. A postgres database created, with name same as `main_module` you provided.
2. Installed all the python dependencies in virtualenv
3. Local settings added to `.env` file (untracked)
4. Initialized a git repo and created the first commit.

Now the only thing you'll need to do is:

1. `cd` into the new `github_repository` folder just created.
2. Activate virtualenv `source venv/bin/activate`. If you plan to use virtualenvwrapper, you can install the project requirements via `pip install -r requirements/development.txt`
3. Run `fab serve`

__Summarizing__:

```
brew install postgres
sudo pip install fabric cookiecutter
cookiecutter https://github.com/Fueled/cookiecutter-django.git
cd <github_repository>/
source venv/bin/activate
fab serve
```

Don't forget to carefully look at the generated README. Awesome, right?

You can also explore the [wiki] section for details on advance setups and usuages.
